# How it works

We built the back-end systems using sophisticated NLP and speech recognition technologies. User inputted text was analyzed using sentiment analysis and keyword extraction, and was in turn matched with video transcripts (which were obained using Google Cloud-based speech-to-text technology) using semantic similarity. User input (text and video streams) are passed through Flask and Restful API-based server communication between backend Python script, MySQL database and frontend interface to ensure dynamic reflection of algorithm results.
